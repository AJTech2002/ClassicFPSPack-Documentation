## Classic FPS Pack

The Classic FPS Pack developed by [Ajay Venkat](https://www.youtube.com/c/AJTechTV) and [Thomas Brush](https://www.youtube.com/c/AtmosGames), was created as a way to make developing Simple FPS Games easier. Most FPS Assets are bloated and hard to understand, this pack contains scripts that are easy to modify and prefabs that are easy to understand to help you quickly setup a prototype.

It is currently being used in an upcoming indie game [Father](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1575990/Father/) by Thomas Brush.

### Video Documentation

This pack has been documented in 2 forms, both in video form as well as written form. The video documentation contains information about each of the systems within the pack and will give you a good starting point to use them.

This site will give a more detailed account of every script in the pack and give you the groundwork to extend it.
