## FPS Controller
The FPS Controller consists of two main elements, the ****Camera Controller**** and the **Player Controller**.

2. The **Player Controller** allows for the actual movement and interaction of the Player with the game world, the **Player Controller** has 3 Scripts controlling its functionality.
