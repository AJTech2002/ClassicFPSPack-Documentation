## Player Physics

The **PlayerPhysics** Component provides some helper functions to the **PlayerController** that allow it to perform some of the following tasks:

1. Raycast from the Player
2. Spherecast from the Player
3. Check whether it is grounded
4. Check if the Player is in the wall, if so push it out
