## Player Physics

The **PlayerPhysics** Component provides some helper functions to the **PlayerController** that allow it to perform some of the following tasks:

1. Raycast from the Player
2. Spherecast from the Player
3. Check whether it is grounded
4. Check if the Player is in the wall, if so push it out

Take a look at the inspector.

There's a few variables we need to setup for this to function correctly:

- **Gravity Scale** : How quickly the Player is brought down to the ground, where the scaling is relative to the default Unity gravity (-9.81).

- **Disclude Player** : This is the LayerMask ensuring that any Raycasts/Spherecasts from the Player do not intersect with the Player itself.

Note how the **Player** layer is disabled while everything else is enabled, this is why we set the FPSController and all it's children layers to **Player**.

- **Reference Base Point** : Where the 'bottom-half' of the Player lies relative to ```(0,0,0)``` being the direct center of the Player. 

- **Base Radius** : The radius of the 'bottom-half' of the Player, this is the sphere that will be used to check against the ground for the groundind status. 

The last two variables discussed will generate a Gizmos that can be visualised like this:

The bottom blue sphere is the Gizmos generated by the **Reference Base Point** and **Base Radius**.
