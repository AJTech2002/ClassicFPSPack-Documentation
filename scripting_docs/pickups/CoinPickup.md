# Coin Pickup

Coin Pickup derives from `Pickup`, so it tracks the state of whether or not this item has been picked up.

**Note: This item needs a trigger.**

This affects the player's coin amount in the `PlayerStatistics` script, then updates the UI.

## Public Variables

1. **pickupAmount**: Amount of coins to pickup when the player moves over it.
